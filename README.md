A polling app created with Django and Python.

This repo demonstrates a polling app, created with Django and Python. The polling app shows a number of different questions along with responses. The app allows users to vote on the questions and then see the results for the questions.  The Django App was inspired by the work of [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1IyzVyrLSU) and it makes use of Bootstrap formatting.
